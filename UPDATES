UPDATED:
- This document contains all of the things that have been changed, removed, added or fixed from the last version.
- Some of the things listed here may not have been in the last version, they may just be things i've fixed/changed while
  making this version, so just disregard them.

CHANGED:
- All text/data files have been moved to the set(data.dir) directory. This includes 8ball, topics, quickban etc.
- Channel information procedures; chaninfo, setchaninfo ;have been changed into; changet, chanset.
- The 'addmainchan' procedure now sets the eggdrop 'chanmode' to "" (NULL) and gathers all main information for the script.
- set(SERVICE), ChanOP, NickOP, NoteOP have been set to lowercase variables; set(chanop), set(nickop), set(noteop).
- Reading and writing the data files is changed, now uses writefile, readfile, remfile, listfile procedures. This has also
  changed the way 'commands' (channel, query command) works, and displays the commands.
- What the bot says if a channel is inactive, or doesn't exist on a command.
- When a bot (+b flag) does a command like kick, deop, devoice and oprestrict is active, the script will not deop that bot.
- When the bot joins a channel, gets opped and oprestrict is active, it will not deop bots with the +b flag.
- When the two-hourly settings check goes off, users marked as a bot (+b flag) will not be deleted if they don't have any
  Services access.
- Owners with +o, +m, +n can setuser at any level, even below the command level for setuser, and can change other users
  access if they have less access in the channel.
- bind mode .. is no longer used, instead the eggdrop collects the information straight from the server using raw .. mode ..
  this makes the bot allow +e on servers without ban excepts.
- The script now uses putquick queue instead of puthelp queue to talk to services and set usermode, this allows AOP and
  Killing quicker.
- All previously mentions .settings files are now renamed to .dat files.

REMOVED:
- com.settings file no longer exists, the script now writes default settings to individual channels.

ADDED:
- The script now changes the following characters into '-' for channel/nickname files, allows storage: /\:"*?><|
- All command levels are now channel specific, you can change these with the comset command.
- comset and comget procedures to change, view the command settings for channels.
- All static global set(*) variables are now saved into the 'set(set.file)' file and cannot be changed with the configuration
  file, only with .botset in partyline.
- Channel ReportLog logfile now works, and sends the logfile's via E-mail when the eggdrop logfiles get swapped.
- Using message commands with 8ball, mimic and fun will now say that you must use the channel.
- The partyline command 'mainchan' to add, remove, set main channels.
- The partyline command 'homechan' to set the home channel.
- The noting system, you can now message the bot with; read, send, list, del, purge.
- The ability to add your own commands to adduser, deluser, auth and deauth. Use the set(command.file) variable to set your
  script filenames. A small example is in the 'data.tar.gz' included with this script. Unfortunately the scripts can only
  be one-liners.
- Note system added tellset, telladd, tellsetu, telldel in channel owner settings, will send via script noting system.
- If a nickname is opped on auth and AOP is active for a channel, the script will not voice them.
- When someone gets suspended the script now deops and devoices if oprestrict is active, or inactive.
- The set(banmask) option in the configuration file to choose your default man method.
- Protection when someone deops a protected member of the channel.
- 'setme' command for privmsg, similar to Nickname Server 'set', couldn't use 'set' because of Channel Service commands. Not
  all associated commands are functioning, wait until next version.
- A little more information to nickname information (/msg bot info nick) for bot admin.
- The banquota setting (/msg bot set #channel banquota xx) now has '0' as an option to turn it off.
- You now have to add your own mimic people to a file, instead of using pre-made ones in the bot.

FIXED:
- If nochanmsg was active, the script would say `commands, changed to $set(cmd)commands instead.
- Error in op, mimic, fun TCL's that stopped from working, a variable that didn't exist.
- Miss-spelled 'incr' in the ban TCL
- Error in pub_op procedure that stopped from opping more then one person at a time.
- Error in msg_op procedure, used [lindex $text 0] instead of $chan.
- Text error in the deop TCL that said '199' of another user level instead of their actual level.
- If a client disconnected from the socket TCL (not in v2.0) it would leave an error in the partyline.
- -min and -max did not work in the access TCL.
- In the ban TCL, had to change the 'ischanban' command into 'isban' because it looked for a ban on the channel modes, not
  the eggdrop bans.
- If a user was removed from a channel while suspended, it would leave a constant error in the partyline and wouldn't
  unsuspend them.
- The -suspend procedure now removes all timers associated with the suspend in question, this tkaes out ALL associated errors
- In the unban TCL, if you used me, or <host> it didn't unban if the ban wasnt set by the eggdrop.
- The fun command printed out 'damian' instead of your nickname, when someone didn't specify a nickname to do the action to.
- The bug with suspensions that came up with the error about the user '*' being suspended.
- Some annoying little bugs that printed errors like 'You are not authenticated.' in channels you didn't have access in.
