DESCRIPTION: This is for when you adduser a user without anything else
             - (+adduser nick). It just shows what to set it to. The format

--

# VARIABLE:  set(sockcommand)
DESCRIPTION: I dont know if I'm going to release the socket authentication,
             - access list, listban list with this version so this should
             - just be set to '0' to turn it off.
EXAMPLE:
 - set set(sockcommand) "0"
   - Turns the socket commands off so they are not able to work. You
   - shouldn't have the script for this so if you turn it on you are just
   - stuffing the bot up.

--

# VARIABLE:  set(listenport)
DESCRIPTION: This is also for the socket authentication, access list,
             - listban list so just ignore it and dont set it to anything.
EXAMPLE:
 - set set(listenport) ""
   - Makes the listen port unable to start because you shouldnt have the
   - scripts to use this command anyway.

             #################################################             
             #  Changes/additions to the eggdrop.conf file   #             
             #################################################             

All the information below this is for your own good. If you do not change
this shit in your eggdrop config file, the script may stuff up and not work
so may I suggest you READ IT CAREFULLY and make any changes it says to.

- When the socket commands are in place, the 'listen xxxx all/bot/user' in
  your comfiguration file MUST NOT be the same as the 'set(listenport)' in
  the services.conf file, if they are the script wont be able to listen on
  the port, causing an error to arrouse.

- The timezone (set timezone "") in the configuration file should be set to
  the real timezone, this will make it easier for clients added to the bot
  to see where the bot is and what the time is compared to them, it's all
  for the access/listban and suspension shit, no one wants to think they are
  suspended for a minute when they are really suspended for another day.

- For safety of the bot and script you should make it so only YOU (the owner)
  can set flags of users, and that flags dont get assigned to people as soon
  as they are added to the bot. All you have to do for this is change one.
  Locate this line in your config file (it may be different):
  : set default-flags "fh"
  And change it to this:
  : set default-flags ""
  This will make it so the bot doesn't let people get into the partyline when
  they are added and stuff like that.

- If you have added a channel as a static channel (home channel, main channel
  etc) make the 'chanmode' to "" - This will conflict against the script.
  Fighting built in eggdrop features with a script is bad.

- I suggest that you set the flood message setting so it doesnt ever ignore,
  this will stop the NickOP/NoteOP from being ignored when they want the bot
  to do something. All you need to do is change this line (may be different):
  : set flood-msg 10:60
  To this:
  : set flood-msg 0:0

- If the script is going to be used in a lot of channels, you should change
  the queuesize of messages so it can handle a lot of messages. In your
  configuration file look for this next line (it may be different):
  : set max-queue-msg 20
  And change it to something like this:
  : set max-queue-msg 300

- Because the access list and listban list may have some lines of text that
  are exactly the same (-whoset, -lm etc) you must change this next line
  in your configuration file so it can handle more then one line exactly the
  same in a command. Look for these three lines in your config file:
  : set double-mode 0
  : set double-server 0
  : set double-help 0
  And change all three so they have '1's instead of '0's, like this:
  : set double-mode 1
  : set double-server 1
  : set double-help 1

- This isnt a must-do thing, but if you dont change these two settings, the
  script wont work to the best of its ability when it comes to mode changes.
  The top setting is how many bans are allowed on a channel at once, if you
  dont know how many the Network has, ban as many as you can and count them!
  The bottom setting is how many modes the Network can handle at once, check
  this in a similar way as the bans, type: '/mode #channel +ooooooooo nick1
  nick2 nick3 nick4 nick5 nick6 nick7 nick8 nick9' :change the #channel and
  nicknames of course, and cound to the last nickname that gets op'd. thats
  the maximum modes allowed by the server. In your configuration file look
  for these two lines (the shouldnt be far apart, and they are different):
  : set max-bans 20
  : set max-modes 4
  Change the 'max-bans' variable to the amount of bans the server can have,
  and the 'max-modes' variable to the amoubt of modes at once it can have.
  On AustNet you should set these to the following:
  : set max-bans 30
  : set max-modes 6

- The '/msg botnick ident' and '/msg botnick addhost' arent needed on the bot
  the script does all the work for this. '/msg botnick auth <password>' does
  the trick, and it actually shows who authenticated, so it's good. The two
  lines you are looking for are these (they may be a little different):
  : unbind msg - ident *msg:ident
  : unbind msg - addhost *msg:addhost
  If they start with the word 'bind' change it to 'unbind'. Any other things
  similar to those around near where they are, do the same thing with them.

- This doesnt have anything to do with the script, but its just a hint. In
  your configuration file, look for a line that looks something like this:
  : set max-filesize 1024
  Set the variable to something like '9999999' and you can send the bot
  nearly any sized file without it saying 'file-size too large' and not
  accepting it. example:
  : set max-filesize 9999999

- The last thing in this version of Services is that the 'init-server'
  variable in the configuration file is absolutely useless. Anything you
  want added to this variable.. you cant add! In the next version you will
  be able to set a variable with all of this in it, so wait until then.
