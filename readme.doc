### Information [other information you may need to know]:              ###
#### This readme file is basically to tell you about what you need to  ####
chanset
#### set up before you actually use the TCL. This TCL isn't for the    ####
#### users who know nothing about eggdrop, IRC or TCL, you must have   ####
#### at least some knowledge of all three, or the set up process will  ####
#### be difficult for you.                                             ####
#### Over all the setup is simple, you edit a few files, add a few (if ####
#### they arent already with the TCL) and then load it.                ####
#### Hint: before looking through this readme, take a look through the ####
#### 'conf.doc' file that came with this one and edit the              ####
#### 'services.doc' file to change to your own settings, if you do it  ####
#### before you have a glance through this one you will understand the ####
#### files and settings in this much better.                           ####

             #             Must-know information             #             
             #################################################             

All  of the information below is must-know stuff when using this TCL.  Over
time  this  will definately get larger and larger, so keep track  with  it.

- This  TCL has only been tested on eggdrop v1.4.3, v1.4.4, v1.4.5. I  know
  it  will  not  work on any version above 1.5.0, and it may  not  work  on
  versions  lower then 1.4.0. There is a stop feature in the TCL to prevent
  it from working on these versions and crashing your bot, so beware!

- This  version is an alpha version of the Services TCL, released so people
  would  be quiet and stop annoying me with 'release v2.1!', it comes  with
  no  support from #Testikles`, if you go in there, or message me for help,
  you will be ignored, no questions asked.

- If  people dont read this its their fault. Before you can use this script
  in  any  channels,  you must add yourself. How do you do  this?  Use  the
  'addme'  command. The usage of it is simple (/msg botnick addme  password
  channel), a better syntax and cripe is written below.

- These  Services will not work like normal services, they are connected to
  a  server via another server (the services server), which these  services
  DO  NOT  HAVE. Trying to connect them will just end in tragety.  It's  an
  eggdrop,  connect  like you would any other client to IRC. I  may  remake
  them in *proper* TCL so they can run, but until then who knows.

- There  are  a  few things I'm still working on that should have  been  in
  this  version  of  the script, they will definately be in the  next  one.
  These things include; nickname settings, seen script. Encourage me on IRC
  and  tell  me to get my ass working overtime, I want to get this done,  I
  just havent got the time at the moment, sorry.

- All of the Services settings (for Channel service, Nickname service, Memo
  service  etc.) was made for AustNet Services which arent the same as  all
  services..  they are actually quite unique. So what I'm saying is if  you
  arent  on  AustNet most/all of these probably wont work, give them all  a
  try though.

- Before  ripping the shit out of this script consult me, it's a bitch when
  you  see  all of your scripts being used in other scripts and the  people
  are  calling  them  their own, and/or didnt even let you know  about  the
  script  in  the first place. If I see anyone doing this I will  take  the
  script  down  from the website and not make it for anyone but myself  and
  the  channels I run and maintain. It's up to you if you want to see  more
  versions coming out :)

- If  you find a loophole in what I just said, and it sounds ANYTHING  like
  what  I just wrote, it means EXACTLY the same thing so do it and the  end
  result will be the same.

- All  of the scripts and documentation should go together in one  archive,
  if  they  are  seperated the people trying to load/use  the  script  will
  probably  get it all wrong, and we dont want anyone stuffing up too  much
  on an easy-to-use TCL like this do we? :)

- The 'NoteOP' is still in it's trial stages, so if something majorly fucks
  itself during use, don't use it, and let me know :)

- Yet  again I have failed to complete the 'VoteOP' system, somehow I doubt
  it  will  get  completed  until one completely boring day,  when  I  have
  nothing else to do.

- If  you  find  any  bugs in the script or you think  anything  should  be
  changed  (this  includes  spelling mistakes and things) gimme a  yell  on
  AustNet or by Email, I would muchly appreciate it.

- When setting directories in the configuration file, use '/' as apposed to
  '\',  else the bot will not see the slashes, it will think they are  just
  the character after the slash.

             #################################################             
             #         Commands and extra information        #             
             #################################################             

This bit of information shows all of the channel/query/partyline commands,
how they are used, what they do, any additional information you may want to
know, and if they have options (-option) what the option means.
This is how they all look:
-
# <command>: - <syntax>
             - <syntax>
    * <-option> -> <explination>
  - <what its used for>
  * <additional information>
-

The syntax for all commands is located in the <command>.etcl file too. If the
command is '+command ..' with only the '+' at the front, it means it can only
be used in the channel. If it is /msg then it can be used in query, if there
is a '[<channel>]' after the command, it can also be used in the channel. If
the command is prefixed with a '.' then it is to be used in the partyline.

# 8ball:    - +8ball <question>
  - Just like a Magic 8ball

# Access:   - /msg botnick access [<channel>] [<wildcard match> <-online> <-userhost> <-lm> <-ls> <-host match> <-min level> <-max level>]
            - .access <#channel> [<wildcard match> <-online> <-userhost> <-lm> <-ls> <-host match> <-min level> <-max level>]
    * -online -> Displays if the user is online or offline
    * -userhost -> Displays a users userhost (identd@domain.com)
    * -lm -> Displays who last modified the user, and when it happened
    * -ls -> Displays when the user was last seen
    * -host <match> -> Matches the 'match' against the users userhost (identd@domain.com)
    * -min <level> -> Displays only users who have access above and equal to 'level'
    * -max <level> -> Displays only users who have access below and equal to 'level'
  - The access list of a channel database
  * The access command also shows if a user is suspended or not, with all information associated

# Addme:    - addme <password> <channel>
  - Add yourself to a channel (needed at startup)
  * The password in this is the 'set(adminpass)' you set in the configuration file

# Adduser:  - /msg botnick adduser [<channel>] <nickname> [<level> <-userhost host> <-aop on/off> <-aov 1/0> <-protect yes/on>
    * -userhost <host> -> Sets/adds this host as the users if they havent been added it sets as their only
    * -aop <..> -> Sets the AOP for the user on/off (1, on, yes = On || 0, off, no = Off)
    * -aov <..> -> Sets the AOV for the user on/off (1, on, yes = On || 0, off, no = Off)
    * -protect <..> -> Sets the Protect for the user on/off (1, on, yes = On || 0, off, no = Off)
  - Adds a user to the channel database
  * Unlike AustNet Services, the AOP/AOV/Protect doesnt change depending on the value, it is set default to your 'set(autoadd)' in the configuration

# Auth:     - /msg botnick auth <password>
            - /msg botnick id <password>
            - /msg botnick identify <password>
           -- SOCKET:
            - /botcommand <your handle> <your password> [<extra commands>]
            - ./botcommand <your nickname> <you handle> <your password>
  - Authenticate to the bot
  * All three of these commands are exactly the same

# Deauth:   - /msg botnick deauth <password>
            - /msg botnick unid <password>
            - /msg botnick unidentify <password>
  - Deauthenticate to the bot
  * All three of these commands are exactly the same

# Ban:      - /msg botnick ban [<channel>] <nickname/banmask> [<-noexpire> <-nokick> <-kickall> <-sticky> <-level level> <-banmask u|h|nu|uh|nh|nuh> <-days N> <-hours N> <-mins N> <-quick option>]
    * -noexpire -> Sets the ban to never expire
    * -nokick -> Doesnt kick the nickname if you specify one
    * -kickall -> Kicks all nicknames matching the banmask
    * -sticky -> Creates a 'sticky ban', it wont be removed from the channel until it expires
    * -level <level> -> Sets the ban so 'level' and higher levels can remove it, good for 200+ owners
    * -banmask <u|h|nu|uh|nh|nuh> -> Sets the banmask to whichever you specify (n = nickname, u = user [identd], h = host [domain])
    * -days <n> -> Sets the ban to expire in 'n' days
    * -hours <n> -> Sets the ban to expire in 'n' hours
    * -mins <n> -> Sets the ban to expire in 'n' minutes
    * -quick <option> -> Chooses an option from the quickban file
  - Bans a user or host in the channel you do it in
  * The -days|-hours|-mins can be used together and will add up to the appropriate value

# Clean:    - /msg botnick clean [<channel>]
  - Cleans the channel modes from the channel, and sets the modelock modes back if you are under the required access level

# Clist:    - /msg botnick clist <nickname> [<send to nickname>]
  - Sends a nickname a Channel List (a list of all the channels they have access in), 'send to nickname' is the nickname you send to, it will send to you if you dont specify
  * This command can only be used by 'special users'

# Commands: - /msg botnick commands [<channel>]
  - Lets you check what commands you can use in the channel

# Comset:   - /msg botnick comset [<channel>] <command> <value>
    * All of the 'command's used in here are the actual commands on the bot (most of the ones listed in this section)
  - Changes the channel command level, to disable specific level'd users to do specific commands (eg. set the op command to level 190, instead of 100)

# Delme:    - /msg botnick delme [<channel>]
  - Deletes your own access in a channel

# Deluser:  - /msg botnick deluser [<channel>] <nick1> [<nick2> <nick3> ..]
  - Deletes one or more users access in the channel

# Deop:     - /msg botnick deop [<channel>] [<nick1> <nick2> <nick3> ..]
  - Deops you or another user in the channel
  * If you dont specify anything after 'deop' it will deop you

# Devoice:  - /msg botnick devoice [<channel>] [<nick1> <nick2> <nick3> ...]
  - Devoices you or another user in the channel
  * If you dont specify anything after 'devoice' it will devoice you

# Fun:      - +fun <cleanoffice|milk|milo|squish|lamebot|opers|coffee|time|bonk|lix|moo|chocolate|icecream|droolz|shagz|d0nk|slobbers|bash> [<nickname>]
  - Just a small joke, try out the different options (cleanoffice, milk, milo etc.) to see what they do :)

# Info:     - /msg botnick info <nickname/channel>
  - Get the information of a 'ChanOP' channel or nickname that is on the Services TCL
  * Unlike other commands this can be used in the channel or query

# Invite:   - /msg botnick invite <channel>
  - Invites you to a channel, you cannot use this to invite others

# Kick:     - /msg botnick kick [<channel>] <nickname> [<message>]
  - Kicks a user the channel, with a message

# Listban:  - /msg botnick listban [<channel>] [<wildcard match> <-whoset> <-whenset> <-lastactive> <-reason> <-min N> <-max N>]
            - .listban <channel> [<wildcard match> <-whoset> <-whenset> <-lastactive> <-reason> <-min N> <-max N>]
    * -whoset     -> Displays who set the ban
    * -whenset    -> Displays when the ban was set
    * -lastactive -> Displays when the ban was last activated (this isnt very accurate..)
    * -reason     -> Displays the reason why the banmask was banned

    * -max <n>    -> Only displays bans that were set by someone with access under and the same as 'n'
  - Shows the list of bans current in the settings of the script for that channel
  * If the banlist user has been deleted the reasons may be wrong

# Mdeop:    - /msg botnick mdeop [<channel>]
  - Deops everyone in the channel apart from itself

# Mdevoice: - /msg botnick mdevoice [<channel>]
  - Devoices everyone in the channel

# Mimic:    - +mimic <nickname>

  * This command will mimic anyone who is listed in the set(mimic.file) file

# Note:     - /msg botnick note send <nick/chan[,nick/chan] [-min level] [-max level] <message>
            - /msg botnick note read <new|all|N[n,n,n]>
            - /msg botnick note list <new|all[null]|old>
            - /msg botnick note del <all|new|n[,n,n,n]|old>
            - /msg botnick note purge
  - Similar to the Memo Service on most networks, an almost exact replica of the NoteOP on AUSTnet. This allows you to store/read/list/delete notes stored in note files

# Op:       - /msg botnick op [<channel>] [<nick1> <nick2> <nick3> ...]
  - Ops you or another user in the channel
  * If you dont specify anything after 'op' it will op you

# Resetdb:  - /msg botnick resetdb [<channel>] [<level>]
  - Resets the channel user database, if you specify a level it will only delete below that
  * Be careful with this, you could remove yourself :P

# Seek:     - /msg botnick seek [<channel>] [<-online>] <message>
    * -online -> Sends a list of people who are online in the channel to you without letting others know
  - Sends a message to everyone who is online in the channel saying the 'message'
  * If the 'nonote' is higher then your access in the channel, this wont send any messages to others

# Set:      - /msg botnick set [<channel>] <keeptopic|mode|nonote|oprestrict|restrict|mustid|tellpeak|tellset|telladd|telldel|nochanmsg|funmsg|url|log|owner|address> <newvalue>

    * nonote     -> Restrict channel notes (Memo's, seeks)
    * oprestrict -> Restrict the people who are opd (this is used like; set oprestrict <level>) -- I have kept on/off in there for people who dont read this
    * restrict   -> Restrict the people who join the channel
    * mustid     -> When the bot is opd it will auto-auth (kinda) people who are op'd, deop'd in the channel (security relies on the same as the normal auth features)
    * tellpeak   -> Message the channel when the peak breaks
    * tellset    -> Notifies the owner(s) when someone uses set

    * nochanmsg  -> Makes the channel users have to use /msg commands instead of +commands
    * funmsg     -> Turns fun messages on (similar to ChanOP on AustNet but turns +8ball, +fun and +mimic on)
    * url        -> Changes the channel URL
    * log        -> Only 200+ accessed users can use this, it sets the report log on and off
    * owner      -> Sets the channel owner(s) (seperate each by a space)
    * address    -> Sets the channel address (shown in info)
    * quota      -> Sets the quota on the channel (set to '0' for unlimited)
    * banquota   -> Sets the ban quota on the channel (set to '0' for unlimited)
  - Change the main settings of each individual channel
  * In the next version of Services all of these settings will be working, and more *should* be added

# Setme:    - /msg botnick setme <email|pass|url|asl|usemsg|autoid|aov|aop|showemail|noteonadd|noteondel|noteonset|tellbyemail> <new value>

    * tellbyemail -> Instead of sending notes (noteonadd, noteondel, noteonset, tellset, telladd etc.) via the note system, it will send an email every 24hrs containing all notes

# Setuser:  - /msg botnick setuser [<channel>] <nickname> <level|aop|aov|protect|suspend|nickname> <new value>

If there is anything else you want to know about the script, or anything else
that I know or should know, Email me or message me on IRC (irc.austnet.org)
my nickname is usually 'Cyborg-' NoteOP me or something if I aint there. The
channel I'm ALWAYS in is #Testikles` so drop in and cause a riot!
