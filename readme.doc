 #########################################################################
### Information [other information you may need to know]:              ###
#### This readme file is basically to tell you about what you need to  ####
#### set up before you actually use the TCL. This TCL isn't for the    ####
#### users who know nothing about eggdrop, IRC or TCL, you must have   ####
#### at least some knowledge of all three, or the set up process will  ####
#### be difficult for you.                                             ####
#### Over all the setup is simple, you edit a few files, add a few (if ####
#### they arent already with the TCL) and then load it.                ####
#### Hint: before looking through this readme, take a look through the ####
#### 'conf.doc' file that came with this one and edit the              ####
#### 'services.doc' file to change to your own settings, if you do it  ####
#### before you have a glance through this one you will understand the ####
#### files and settings in this much better.                           ####

             #################################################             

The files and folders listed and written about below are there to make
the Services TCL run better, run all together, or just anything, all files
with the compressed file are accounted for. Some you may have to make,
and/or edit, others are already how you should keep them. 
Most of the files below can be found on the script website in the accessories
part (if there is one) with the filename I have suggested, if it isn't ask
me on IRC for it (irc.austnet.org - #Testikles`), my nickname is 'Cyborg-'
or send me an Email asking for this file (and any others you may need)

# The command list file.
 - This is the file you set in your config file (set(com.file)). It refers
   to the file that has all of the commands in it, along with the access
   a user needs to be able to use it. I call my one of these 'com.settings'
 
   The commands should be listed as follows:
  -
  command==level
  command==level
  - example;
  ban==100
  8ball==1
  -
   These are all the commands in the TCL to date, they should ALL be
   accounted for. If they arent anyone can use the command.
   8ball, access, adduser, ban, clean, commands, delme, deluser, deop
   devoice, fun, info, invite, kick, listban, mdeop, mdevoice, mimic, op
   resetdb, seek, set, setuser, topic, unban, voice

# The topics file.
 - This file is the one used for all of the random topics for the 'topic'
   command. When you use the topic command without anything after (eg. 
   +topic), it will choose a random line from this file to set as the
   topic. If this file doesnt exist when you try and use the topic feature
   without any parameters it will return '' (nothing) and set no topic.

   I call this file 'topics.txt' because its got topics in it and its a
   normal text file. Every new topic is put on a new line, here is an
   example:
  -
  No dodgy subjects. Just ones outta the blue.
  Our coffee is so good we even drink it ourselves, on occasion.
  Press any key...no, no, no, NOT THAT ONE!
  Press any key to continue or any other key to quit...
  Press CTRL-ALT-DEL to continue....
  -
   Not a bad set of topics, a little lame tho.

# The 8ball answer file.
 - This file is the one used for all of the answers when you type +8ball
   <question> (changing the '+' to your prefix..). Without this file the
   script will always come up with '' (nothing) when you use the 8ball
   feature.

   I call this file '8ball.txt' for obvious reasons; the file is a normal
   text file and it's for the 8ball. On every line in the text file you
   put a different answer to the questions, here is an example:
  -
  Yes.
  No.
  Are you kidding?
  What do you think I am, and 8ball?
  -
   Simple yet effective answers if I do say so myself.

# The quickban file.
 - This is the file used for the ban command. The syntax of ban is as
   follows:
  -
  +ban <nickname|hostname> [<-nokick> <-kickall> <-noexpire> <-sticky>
  <-level level> <-banmask u|h|nu|uh|nh|nuh> <-days N> <-hours N>
  <-mins N> <-quick option>]

  Your right! There are a hell of a lot of options, but they all serv
  a purpose, below is the commands documentation on the commands.
  -
   In all those options there is one called '-quick' which is the
   'quickban' option. The quickban file contains all of the messages
   available in this, and it is set out as follows:
  -
  option==reason
  option==reason
  - example;
  ooga=ooga booga to you!
  virus=You have a virus, please join #AvA for assistance.
  -
   This file is located in the script directory, and on mine it is called
   'quickban.ssf' (.stf being services setting file).

# The conf.doc file.
 - As you may know, the conf.doc file is a document containing all you
   need to know about setting up your eggdrops configuration file and
   the 'services.conf' file included with this TCL. Read through it all,
   and try not to miss anything out, it could leave you wondering why
   your bot isn't doing what one of your mates is :)

# The services.conf file.
 - The services.conf file is the single most important file of the whole
   TCL. It is the file that makes it easy for anyone to load this TCL, all
   you need to do is edit it and run basically, simple. More information
   on this file can be read about in the 'conf.doc' file with this archive.

# The script files.
 - In this version of Services TCL there are thirty-two files containing
   different parts of the scripts. Most are the commands, which are most
   of the .etcl files (8ball, access, addme, adduser, auth, ban, clean,
   clist, commands, delme, deluser, deop, devoice, fun, info, invite,
   kick, listban, mdeop, mdevoice, mimic, op, resetdb, seek, set, setuser,
   topic, unban, voice). The other three are the main heart-and-soul of
   the TCL. 'main.etcl' is for all the different server things; join, part, 
   quit, mode, topic, nick, kick and a little bit on other things like the
   startup shit. 'procedures.etcl' is full of the smaller procedures that
   make up the script, from the 'check_settings' procedure (checks main
   settings and crap) to the 'isnum' procedure (tells if a piece of text
   is a number or not), this file has the usage and description of every
   procedure in it. 'services.etcl' is full of the Services stuff from the
   Networks Services like 'ChanOP', 'NickOP' and 'NoteOP', nothing very
   interesting in there.

# The data directory.
 - This directory is where all of the channel settings and log files go
   as well as the main script settings files. The directory must be
   created BEFORE running the script or it will just stop as soon as the
   bot starts or you load the 'services.conf' file.

             #################################################             
             #             Must-know information             #             
             #################################################             

All of the information below is must-know stuff when using this TCL. Over
time this will definately get larger and larger, so keep track with it.

- If people dont read this its their fault. Before you can use this script
  in any channels, you must add yourself. How do you do this? Use the
  'addme' command. The usage of it is simple (/msg botnick addme password
  channel), a better syntax and cripe is written below.

- These Services will not work like normal services, they are connected to
  a server via another server (the services server), which these services
  DO NOT HAVE. Trying to connect them will just end in tragety. It's an
  eggdrop, connect like you would any other client to IRC. I may remake
  them in *proper* TCL so they can run, but until then who knows.

- There are a few things I'm still working on that should have been in
  this version of the script, they will definately be in the next one.
  These things include; Report Log, user set to set their own commands.
  Encourage me on IRC and tell me to get my ass working overtime, I want
  to get this done, I just havent got the time at the moment, sorry.

- All of the Services settings (for Channel service, Nickname service, Memo
  service etc.) was made for AustNet Services which arent the same as all
  services.. they are actually quite unique. So what I'm saying is if you
  arent on AustNet most/all of these probably wont work, give them all a
  try though.

- Before ripping the shit out of this script consult me, it's a bitch when
  you see all of your scripts being used in other scripts and the people
  are calling them their own, and/or didnt even let you know about the
  script in the first place. If I see anyone doing this I will take the
  script down from the website and not make it for anyone but myself and
  the channels I run and maintain. It's up to you if you want to see more
  versions coming out :)

- If you find a loophole in what I just said, and it sounds ANYTHING like
  what I just wrote, it means EXACTLY the same thing so do it and the end
  result will be the same.

- All of the scripts and documentation should go together in one archive,
  if they are seperated the people trying to load/use the script will
  probably get it all wrong, and we dont want anyone stuffing up too much
  on an easy-to-use TCL like this do we? :)

- In this version of Services the 'socket commands' arent added, I did this
  because I'm trying to find one small thing about Linux that I dont know,
  that is how to make this;
   ./command parameters
  accept more then three or four parameters without fucking itself. If you
  can help me with this, please Email/message me or something, I need help!
  If I still cant find this by the next version then I will release it with
  a dodgy version of the Linux authentication and shit that hasnt really
  got any other commands in it :(

- The 'NoteOP' I havent made yet, so bare with me, I will eventually make
  two versions, one for Windows that uses the built in note system on
  eggdrop, and another for Linux/Unix.. that uses my own files and stuff
  for the note storage. All you will need to do is load it when you load
  the rest of the Services and it will addapt itself, maybe in future
  versions of the rest of the versions I will add both and you choose
  which one you want to use, not sure how she will work.

- The settings files can get stuffed up sometimes when it writes stuff to
  them, it writes a whole heap of junk down the bottom that I dont know
  how to get rid of without writing another file (which wont make it
  Windows compat), so I have decided to leave it. If you know the solution
  to this, Email/message once again with how, thanks. This will in no way
  make any of the settings be wrong, it just adds a little something to
  the end of the file.

- There was going to be a 'VoteOP' system on this script, but it seems I
  havent really had time to complete it, it will be on the website ASAP,
  but until then you will have to SUFFER!

- If you find any bugs in the script or you think anything should be changed
  (this includes spelling mistakes and things) gimme a yell on AustNet or
  by Email, I would muchly appreciate it.

             #################################################             
             #         Commands and extra information        #             
             #################################################             

This bit of information shows all of the channel/query/partyline commands,
how they are used, what they do, any additional information you may want to
know, and if they have options (-option) what the option means.
This is how they all look:
-
# <command>: - <syntax>
             - <syntax>
    * <-option> -> <explination>
  - <what its used for>
  * <additional information>
-

The syntax for all commands is located in the <command>.etcl file too. If the
command is '+command ..' with only the '+' at the front, it means it can only
be used in the channel. If it is /msg then it can be used in query, if there
is a '[<channel>]' after the command, it can also be used in the channel. If
the command is prefixed with a '.' then it is to be used in the partyline.

# 8ball:    - +8ball <question>
  - Just like a Magic 8ball

# Access:   - /msg botnick access [<channel>] [<wildcard match> <-online> <-userhost> <-lm> <-ls> <-host match> <-min level> <-max level>]
            - .access <#channel> [<wildcard match> <-online> <-userhost> <-lm> <-ls> <-host match> <-min level> <-max level>]
    * -online -> Displays if the user is online or offline
    * -userhost -> Displays a users userhost (identd@domain.com)
    * -lm -> Displays who last modified the user, and when it happened
    * -ls -> Displays when the user was last seen
    * -host <match> -> Matches the 'match' against the users userhost (identd@domain.com)
    * -min <level> -> Displays only users who have access above and equal to 'level'
    * -max <level> -> Displays only users who have access below and equal to 'level'
  - The access list of a channel database
  * The access command also shows if a user is suspended or not, with all information associated

# Addme:    - addme <password> <channel>
  - Add yourself to a channel (needed at startup)
  * The password in this is the 'set(adminpass)' you set in the configuration file

# Adduser:  - /msg botnick adduser [<channel>] <nickname> [<level> <-userhost host> <-aop on/off> <-aov 1/0> <-protect yes/on>
    * -userhost <host> -> Sets/adds this host as the users if they havent been added it sets as their only
    * -aop <..> -> Sets the AOP for the user on/off (1, on, yes = On || 0, off, no = Off)
    * -aov <..> -> Sets the AOV for the user on/off (1, on, yes = On || 0, off, no = Off)
    * -protect <..> -> Sets the Protect for the user on/off (1, on, yes = On || 0, off, no = Off)
  - Adds a user to the channel database
  * Unlike AustNet Services, the AOP/AOV/Protect doesnt change depending on the value, it is set default to your 'set(autoadd)' in the configuration

# Auth:     - /msg botnick auth <password>
            - /msg botnick id <password>
            - /msg botnick identify <password>
  - Authenticate to the bot
  * All three of these commands are exactly the same

# Deauth:   - /msg botnick deauth <password>
            - /msg botnick unid <password>
            - /msg botnick unidentify <password>
  - Deauthenticate to the bot
  * All three of these commands are exactly the same

# Ban:      - /msg botnick ban [<channel>] <nickname/banmask> [<-noexpire> <-nokick> <-kickall> <-sticky> <-level level> <-banmask u|h|nu|uh|nh|nuh> <-days N> <-hours N> <-mins N> <-quick option>]
    * -noexpire -> Sets the ban to never expire
    * -nokick -> Doesnt kick the nickname if you specify one
    * -kickall -> Kicks all nicknames matching the banmask
    * -sticky -> Creates a 'sticky ban', it wont be removed from the channel until it expires
    * -level <level> -> Sets the ban so 'level' and higher levels can remove it, good for 200+ owners
    * -banmask <u|h|nu|uh|nh|nuh> -> Sets the banmask to whichever you specify (n = nickname, u = user [identd], h = host [domain])
    * -days <n> -> Sets the ban to expire in 'n' days
    * -hours <n> -> Sets the ban to expire in 'n' hours
    * -mins <n> -> Sets the ban to expire in 'n' minutes
    * -quick <option> -> Chooses an option from the quickban file
  - Bans a user or host in the channel you do it in
  * The -days|-hours|-mins can be used together and will add up to the appropriate value

# Clean:    - /msg botnick clean [<channel>]
  - Cleans the channel modes from the channel, and sets the modelock modes back if you are under the required access level

# Clist:    - /msg botnick clist <nickname> [<send to nickname>]
  - Sends a nickname a Channel List (a list of all the channels they have access in), 'send to nickname' is the nickname you send to, it will send to you if you dont specify
  * This command can only be used by 'special users'

# Command:  - /msg botnick command [<channel>]
  - Lets you check what commands you can use in the channel

# Delme:    - /msg botnick delme [<channel>]
  - Deletes your own access in a channel

# Deluser:  - /msg botnick deluser [<channel>] <nick1> [<nick2> <nick3> ..]
  - Deletes one or more users access in the channel

# Deop:     - /msg botnick deop [<channel>] [<nick1> <nick2> <nick3> ..]
  - Deops you or another user in the channel
  * If you dont specify anything after 'deop' it will deop you

# Devoice:  - /msg botnick devoice [<channel>] [<nick1> <nick2> <nick3> ...]
  - Devoices you or another user in the channel
  * If you dont specify anything after 'devoice' it will devoice you

# Fun:      - +fun <cleanoffice|milk|milo|squish|lamebot|opers|coffee|time|bonk|lix|moo|chocolate|icecream|droolz|shagz|d0nk|slobbers|bash> [<nickname>]
  - Just a small joke, try out the different options (cleanoffice, milk, milo etc.) to see what they do :)

# Info:     - /msg botnick info <nickname/channel>
  - Get the information of a 'ChanOP' channel or nickname that is on the Services TCL
  * Unlike other commands this can be used in the channel or query

# Invite:   - /msg botnick invite <channel>
  - Invites you to a channel, you cannot use this to invite others

# Kick:     - /msg botnick kick [<channel>] <nickname> [<message>]
  - Kicks a user the channel, with a message

# Listban:  - /msg botnick listban [<channel>] [<wildcard match> <-whoset> <-whenset> <-lastactive> <-reason> <-min N> <-max N>]
            - .listban <channel> [<wildcard match> <-whoset> <-whenset> <-lastactive> <-reason> <-min N> <-max N>]
    * -whoset -> Displays who set the ban
    * -whenset -> Displays when the ban was set
    * -lastactive -> Displays when the ban was last activated (this isnt very accurate..)
    * -reason -> Displays the reason why the banmask was banned
    * -min <n> -> Only displays bans that were set by someone with access over and the same as 'n'
    * -max <n> -> Only displays bans that were set by someone with access under and the same as 'n'
  - Shows the list of bans current in the settings of the script for that channel
  * If the banlist user has been deleted the reasons may be wrong

# Mdeop:    - /msg botnick mdeop [<channel>]
  - Deops everyone in the channel apart from itself

# Mdevoice: - /msg botnick mdevoice [<channel>]
  - Devoices everyone in the channel

# Mimic:    - +mimic <nickname>
  - Says a silly quote that mimics the nickname
  * This only mimics a few people at the moment, I will make it so you can make your own :)

# Op:       - /msg botnick op [<channel>] [<nick1> <nick2> <nick3> ...]
  - Ops you or another user in the channel
  * If you dont specify anything after 'op' it will op you

# Resetdb:  - /msg botnick resetdb [<channel>] [<level>]
  - Resets the channel user database, if you specify a level it will only delete below that
  * Be careful with this, you could remove yourself :P

# Seek:     - /msg botnick seek [<channel>] [<-online>] <message>
    * -online -> Sends a list of people who are online in the channel to you without letting others know
  - Sends a message to everyone who is online in the channel saying the 'message'
  * If the 'nonote' is higher then your access in the channel, this wont send any messages to others

# Set:      - /msg botnick set [<channel>] <keeptopic|mode|nonote|oprestrict|restrict|mustid|tellpeak|tellset|telladd|telldel|nochanmsg|funmsg|url|log|owner|address> <newvalue>
    * keeptopic -> The topic lock level
    * mode -> The modelock feature (this is used like; set mode <level> <-mo+de-s>)
    * nonote -> Restrict channel notes (Memo's, seeks)
    * oprestrict -> Restrict the people who are opd (this is used like; set oprestrict <level>) -- I have kept on/off in there for people who dont read this
    * restrict -> Restrict the people who join the channel
    * mustid -> When the bot is opd it will auto-auth (kinda) people who are op'd, deop'd in the channel (security relies on the same as the normal auth features)
    * tellpeak -> Message the channel when the peak breaks
    * tellset -> Notifies the owner(s) when someone uses set (not working yet)
    * telladd -> Notifies the owner(s) when someone uses adduser (not working yet)

    * tellsetu -> Notifies the owner(s) when someone uses setuser (not working yet)
    * nochanmsg -> Makes the channel users have to use /msg commands instead of +commands
    * funmsg -> Turns fun messages on (similar to ChanOP on AustNet but turns +8ball, +fun and +mimic on)
    * url -> Changes the channel URL
    * log -> Only 200+ accessed users can use this, it sets the report log on and off (not working yet)
    * owner -> Sets the channel owner(s) (seperate each by a space)
    * address -> Sets the channel address (shown in info)
    * quota -> Sets the quota on the channel (set to '0' for unlimited)
    * banquota -> Sets the ban quota on the channel (set to '0' for unlimited)
  - Change the main settings of each individual channel
  * In the next version of Services all of these settings will be working, and more *should* be added

# Setuser:  - /msg botnick setuser [<channel>] <nickname> <level|aop|aov|protect|suspend|nickname> <new value>
